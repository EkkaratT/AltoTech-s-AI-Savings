## Model Explanation

This project evaluates different **regression models** to predict energy consumption and savings:

### üîπ Linear Regression
A simple and interpretable model that serves as the **baseline**.

### üîπ Ridge Regression
A variant of linear regression that includes **regularization** to prevent overfitting.

### üîπ Random Forest
An **ensemble method** that builds multiple decision trees to capture **non-linear relationships** in the data.

### üîπ Gradient Boosting
A **boosting method** that combines the predictions of many weak learners to improve accuracy.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- **R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination)**  
  Measures how well the model explains the **variance** in the energy consumption data.

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
  Quantifies the **difference between predicted and actual values**, with lower values indicating better performance.

- **CVRMSE (Coefficient of Variation RMSE)**  
  Normalizes RMSE relative to the **mean**, allowing comparison across different models.

- **NMBE (Normalized Mean Bias Error)**  
  Measures **model bias** by comparing predicted and actual energy values.

## ‚ö° Energy Savings Calculation

### üî∏ Predicted Energy Consumption (Before and After AI Installation)
- The trained models are used to predict energy consumption for both the **pre-AI** and **post-AI** periods.

### üî∏ Savings Calculation
- **Energy Savings (kWh)** = Difference between **actual consumption** and **predicted pre-AI consumption**.
- **Cost Savings (THB)** = Energy savings √ó Cost per unit of energy.

By comparing the predicted and actual energy usage **before and after** the AI system, the app displays:
- **Total energy savings**
- **Percentage savings**
- **Estimated cost savings in THB**

## üå± Future Considerations

### üîÑ IoT Integration & Daily Prediction Updates

Integrate **IoT sensors** within the plant to collect **real-time energy and environmental data** (e.g., temperature, humidity). This data can be used to **update energy consumption predictions daily**, ensuring the dashboard reflects the most **current conditions**.

This approach provides:
- **Timely insights**
- **Faster detection of inefficiencies**
- **More accurate, adaptive energy management**

By continuously updating energy predictions on a daily basis, the system ensures that plant operators are always working with the latest data to optimize energy usage effectively.
